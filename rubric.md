Project Summary: Health and Wellness Journal
--------------------------------------------
The Health and Wellness Journal is a holistic application developed to help users capture all habits and health 
activities that they take in a day, with monitoring and reflection. Combining all the ease of digital logging with 
beautiful visualization, on this platform, users can make informed, data-oriented decisions toward their health and 
lifestyle. Track goals, daily activities, and improvements over time. The app will also provide personalized 
recommendations and insights based on the user's data.

2. Activity Logging: Users can log various activities, including types of exercise, food intake, water consumption, and hours of sleep.
3. Goal Setting and Tracking: Allows users to set health and wellness goals and track their progress towards achieving them.
4. Data Visualization: Utilize graphs and charts to display trends and insights derived from the user's logged data.
5. Personalized Insights: Generate personalized health and wellness tips based on user activity and goals.

##### Proposed Technology Stack:
1. Front-end: React with Redux 
2. Back-end: Node.js with Express 
3. Database: MongoDB 
4. Additional Technologies: JWT for authentication, D3.js for data visualization
